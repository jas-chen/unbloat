# unbloat
> Atomic CSS in JS


## What
To prevent CSS file from bloating.

It's like [Atomic CSS](https://acss.io/), but you don't have to remember [all the complex syntax](https://acss.io/guides/atomic-classes.html).

## Feature
- Styled-component like syntax, well supported by editors
- Can be used in server side (Python, Ruby, Go, etc), as long as it can parse JSON
- Zero runtime - build to static CSS file

## Installation
TBD

## Inspiration
- [Atomic CSS Modules](https://medium.com/yplan-eng/atomic-css-modules-cb44d5993b27)
- [Un-bloat CSS by using multiple classes](https://css-tricks.com/un-bloat-css-by-using-multiple-classes/)
